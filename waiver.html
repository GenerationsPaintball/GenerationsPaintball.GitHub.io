         equipment.
         <br>3. This activity takes place outdoors and therefore includes risks associated
         with exposure to elements, excessive heat, hypothermia, impact of the
         body upon the water, injection of water into my body orifices, encountering
         objects either natural or man-made, exposure to animals with the attendant
         risks of kicking, biting, shying away, running off or otherwise moving

         Release of Liability, Waiver of Claims and Indemnity Agreement.
