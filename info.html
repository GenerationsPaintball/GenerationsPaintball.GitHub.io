						<h2>What is paintball?</h2>
						<p>Paintball is a sport in which players compete, in teams or individually, to eliminate opponents by tagging them with gelatin capsules (referred to as paintballs) which contain a water soluble dye. Paintball also requires people to think and strategize
							quickly and move with strength, speed and agility. Paintballs are propelled from a device called a paintball marker (commonly referred to as a paintball gun). Players learn about teamwork, self-confidence, and develop leadership abilities while
							having fun and relieving stress.</p>

						<h2>First time playing?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> Wear something comfortable that can get muddy. Such as a long sleeve tee shirt, pants, tennis shoes, and a light jacket.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> A hat can be helpful to protect you from the sun and keep the paint out of your hair!
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> Wear comfortable shoes. You will be on your feet all day so make sure you wear something accordingly. Your shoes will end up very dirty by the end of the day so don&#39;t wear something that you want to stay clean.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> You can sign your waiver online ahead of time to save some time when you arrive.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> Some people like to bring a change of clothing to have clean clothes for the ride home!
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> Make sure you arrive earlier than you plan on playing, to give you time to sign waivers, get equipment, listen to our safety introduction (rules), and let us answer any questions you may have.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> Paintballs may leave slight bruises and may cause slight pain. Because of this we offer a limited number of body vests to reduce the impact. You can also wear extra clothing to prevent bruising and discomfort.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> For players that feel that paintball is too painful, there is another option called splatmaster. Splatmaster is a style of paintball, preferably used for children under the age of 8. If you or your child feel that paintball is too painful,
								this is a great alternative with the same level of energy and fun.
							</li>
							<li>
								<font size="30">.</font> We play in rain or shine, so do not get discouraged by the weather (thunder or lightning sadly forces us to stop playing).
